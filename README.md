# Flikipedia

Flikipedia is the project I am currently working on for Bloc. It's based on their template project "Blocpedia" but I decided to rename it. The subtitle was originally going to be "A Wiki by Evan Flint" but I changed it to "A Wiki that Charges People for Some Reason" because completing the coursework involves incorporating the online payment system Stripe in order to charge people to upgrade to a premium account. This is a valuable skill for me to know in order to work on commercial websites in the future, but putting that functionality on a Wiki seemed weird to me, hence the subtitle.

* Built with Ruby 2.3.1 and Rails 5.0.1
